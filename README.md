- "I want to create a platform that will facilitate people to giving gifts to friends and family who are celebrating some milestones."
   - "The receiver will create an account and create their list of potential items. These items will be coming from general e-commerce sites like jiji.com."
   - "The receiver will then share the link with family and friends and especially on their statuses."
   - "The givers will visit the link and place the order by sending the money for the item to the platform’s number."
   - "The platform well then purchase the items, paste the giver’s info and message on it and then deliver it to the receiver."
